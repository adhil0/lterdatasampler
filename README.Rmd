# {lterdatasets}: LTER Data Sampler

The mission of the [Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) Network](https://lternet.edu/) is to "provide the scientific community, policy makers, and society with the knowledge and predictive understanding necessary to conserve, protect, and manage the nation’s ecosystems, their biodiversity, and the services they provide." A specific goal of the LTER is [education and training](https://lternet.edu/education-and-training/) - "to promote training, teaching, and learning about long-term ecological research and the Earth’s ecosystems, and to educate a new generation of scientists." 

The goal of this package is to provide a variety of datasets - one from each of the [28 LTER Network sites](https://lternet.edu/site/) - that are useful for teaching and training in environmental data science. These datasets are subsets of the original data and have been updated - sometimes substantially - from the raw data, as described in the articles. 

We encourage you to explore existing LTER [teaching and training initiatives](https://lternet.edu/education-and-training/), and the **many** other available LTER datasets which can be accessed via the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/). Please contact  cited researchers directly to discuss using data for research purposes or in publication. 

## The datasets

The `lterdatasets` package contains 3 stored data objects (one from each LTER site). The data are summarized below; see individual Articles for data and source details. Note: the three letter prefix for each dataset indicates the LTER site (see full list of site abbreviations [here](https://lternet.edu/site/)).

- [`ntl_icecover`](): Ice Freeze and Thaw Dates for Madison, WI Area Lakes (1853 - 2019), North Temperate Lakes LTER
- [`ntl_airtemp`](): Daily Average Temperature Data in Madison, WI (1869 - 2019), North Temperate Lakes LTER
